<h4 id="motivation" style="text-align: center;">Motivation</h4>
Flexible electronics have been envisioned as devices that are compliant light-weight for a wide range of wearable applications spanning clothing, medicine, and long term health monitoring. Conjugated polymers have proven promising for this application due to their robust electrical performance; however, they tend to be brittle, inflexible, and impractical for scale up manufacturing due to solubility properties. Various methods have been explored for overcoming the lack of mechanical robustness, but often at a sacrifice for the electrical properties of the material. Conjugation break spacers have given promise to altering the mechanical properties of the material, while preserving the electrical behavior. 

<h4 id="overview" style="text-align: center;">Project Overview</h4>

This project aimed to evaluate:
1. The effect of spacer type: ethylhexyllDPP versus decyltetradecylDPP  
2. The influence of alkyll spacer length, ranging from 4 to 10 carbons, on the mechanical and electrical properties of the bulk material
3. The influence of alkyll spacer percentage, ranging from 10% to 40%, on the mechanical and electrical properties of the bulk material
   
# TO DO: add image with the different spacer types + incorporate the text 

where alkyll spacer length and percentage are defined with the following photo:

For this project, I was responsible for performing the mechanical testing on the polymer thin films. This involved: 
1. Preparing samples through spin coating,
2. Analyzing sample properties through surface profilometry in a clean room environment,
3. Performing film-on-elastomer tensile testing,
4. Performing pseudo freestanding film-on-water tensile testing,
5. Post-processing data to determine elastic moduli, strain, and ultimate tensile strength.

A few key observations are noted:
1. effect of conjugation type?

2. As conjugation length increases, modulus, toughness, UTS, and fracture strength decrease and crack onset strain increase
3. As conjugation percentage increases, modulus, toughness, UTS, and fracture strength increase and crack onset strain decrease
4. Generally, the materials with longer alkyll spacer length and lower break spacer percentage exhibit more ductile fracture behavior 
5. As spacer length increases and percentage decrease, the conductivity increases

The aforementioned observations can be inferred from the following graphs.
