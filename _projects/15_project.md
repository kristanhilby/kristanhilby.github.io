<h4 id="moldprep" style="text-align: center;">Mold Preparation</h4>
A clam shell mold type was chosen [why?]

TODO: Add image showing clamshell molding process

##### Manufacturing
The molds were CNC machined out of 6065 aluminum. Despite the potential thermal expansion of the mold, aluminum was still chosen due to its ability to withstand the requisite temperatures for the layup at a reasonable cost. The maximum thermal expansion of the aluminum was [ADD CALC](), which was deemed sufficient for this application.

##### Pre-Treatment
To facilitate the release of the carbon fiber part from the mold, mold preparation and release were used.

##### Material Choice
TODO: Add FEA analysis (why carbon fiber over fiberglass?)
- Bidirectional weave

##### Prepreg Processing and Application 
Four layers of carbon fiber was chosen to achieve a final thickness of 1.5 mm. The template for the prepreg was created by covering the mold in painters tape as follows:

A feathering technique was used to ensure bonding between the top and bottom layers of the clamshell. That is, the prepreg on one side of the mold receded into the mold by approximately 5 mm with each layer, while the top layer
