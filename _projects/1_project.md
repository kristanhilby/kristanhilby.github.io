<h4 id="overview" style="text-align: center;">Motivation</h4>

This research provides insights into the mechanical robustness and fracture behavior of thin films of ductile polymers, particularly relevant for applications in flexible and stretchable electronics. The methodologies employed in this study offer valuable tools for predicting and comparing the mechanical properties of such films.
