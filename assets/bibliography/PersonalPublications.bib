   abstract = {This work presents an evaluation of reversible water electrolysis as method for pneumatic actuation via the electrochemical decomposition of water into hydrogen and oxygen gas. In addition to a theoretical evaluation of the performance of electrochemically-driven pressurized hydrogen generation, pneumatic generation methods were experimentally tested across two axes: performance and compatibility. Through these experiments, the achievable pressure was shown to be at least 0.75 MPa with a flow rate of 0.06 [ L /min]. It was also determined that negligible losses were incurred due to switching from air to hydrogen. Despite low experimental round-trip efficiencies of 0.005%, the reversible electrolysis of water reaction was shown to be a feasible method for pneumatic actuation of soft robots, especially under scenarios where actuator bandwidth is not of concern.},

   abstract = {Stop-rotor aircraft, which utilize a central lifting surface capable of transitioning between rotation and fixed configurations , offer a promising option for improving the efficiency of vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. However, across the transition between rotation and fixed configurations, the necessary airfoil directionality for efficient aerodynamic performance changes. This work presents the design and experimental analysis of a novel reversible morphing airfoil capable of altering the airfoil directionality necessitated for stop-rotor aircraft. Inspired by roll-up chair design by Uros Vitas, the proposed morphing reversible airfoil, henceforth referred to as the folding slat method, takes shape primarily through a flexible strip that is symmetric about the center and consists of a series of rigid trapezoidal extrusions, forming slats, that are mounted on a flexible substrate. The directionality of the airfoil is switched by altering the compression and tension of each side of the strip, thereby pressing and releasing the contact points between the trapezoidal sections. While the proposed folding slat successfully morphed the leading and trailing edge, the experimental evaluation of the morphing airfoil was critical to justify its usage in a real system. As such, a suite of tests evaluating the compression , bending, and fatigue behaviors were performed. From this testing, it was shown that the folding slat could transfer up to a 150 N load without any added electrical energy usage and was able to switch the orientation of the leading and trailing edge at least 1,000 times, while still maintaining adequate stiffness.},

   abstract = {Conjugation-break spacers (CBS) have been shown to enhance the mechanical properties of conjugated polymers. In particular, incorporation of CBS units into semi-random polymers has revealed high ductility and low elastic moduli, attributed to the combined influence of the CBS units and the semi-random architecture. To further elucidate the structure-property relationships in these polymers, two new families of semi-random polymers are reported here. In the first, poly(3-hexylthiophene)-based semi-random polymers incorporating diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units were synthesized in which CBS units with 4-10 carbons were incorporated from 10 to 40% with an equivalent content of 2-decyltetradecyl-DPP (dtdDPP) to overcome solubility limitations previously observed with 2-ethylhexyl-DPP (ehDPP). These polymers had much higher solubility and could attain higher molecular weights, formed films with high integrity, and displayed extraordinary mechanical properties, with elastic moduli as low as 5.45 MPa and fracture strains as high as 398%. In the second family, the content of ehDPP was held constant at 10%, while the CBS content was varied from 10 to 50% (with an eight-carbon spacer) to deconvolute the influence of CBS and DPP content on mechanical properties. Polymer solubility, molecular weight, and processability were not shown to improve dramatically relative to the previous generation of ehDPP polymers with matched DPP and CBS content, but the mechanical properties of this series were quite notable, with elastic moduli as low as 4.08 MPa, an increase in toughness, and fracture strains as high as 432%. The extraordinary mechanical properties exhibited by these polymers can serve as a guide in the judicious selection of monomers and backbone architectures in the future synthesis of semiconducting polymers for flexible electronic applications.},

   abstract = {© 2018 American Chemical Society. An extensive family of semi-random polymers was prepared via Stille polycondensation with varying contents of alkyl spacers incorporated into the polymer backbone to serve as a break in conjugation. This family was investigated to determine the effect of alkyl spacer length and percent incorporation on the optical, electronic, and mechanical properties. The optical bandgap was found to steadily increase from 1.53 to 1.70 eV as the amount of spacer was increased from 10 mol percent to 40 mol percent while the length of the spacer had little to no effect. In space charge limited current (SCLC) carrier mobility measurements, hole mobility was found to decrease as the amount of spacer increased but was found to steadily increase as the length of the spacer was increased from 6 to 10 carbons. Mechanical properties were observed by film-on-elastomer and film-on-water measurements, with low elastic moduli and high ductility attributed both to the break in conjugation as well as the semi-random structure of the polymer backbone. Measurements of the mechanical properties using the buckling method revealed elastic moduli between 0.14 and 1.3 GPa, and several polymers, when bonded to an elastomeric substrate, could be stretched beyond 80% strain. These polymers were further tested as free-standing films by obtaining a pull test on the surface of water, where we obtained tensile moduli between 0.13 and 0.75 GPa. These results indicate that semi-random polymers with conjugation-break spacers are promising candidates for further study in flexible electronics.},

   abstract = {© 2017 American Chemical Society. One of the primary complications in characterizing the mechanical properties of thin films of semiconducting polymers for flexible electronics is the diverse range of fracture behavior that these materials exhibit. Although the mechanisms of fracture are well understood for brittle polymers, they are underexplored for ductile polymers. Experimentally, fracture can be characterized by observing the propagation of cracks and voids in an elongated film. For brittle polymers, we find that films bifurcate in such a way that the crack density increases linearly with applied strain (R2 ≥ 0.91) at small strains. Linear regression is used to estimate the fracture strength and strain at fracture of each material using an existing methodology. For the case of ductile polymers, however, we find that diamond-shaped microvoids, which originate at pinholes and defects within the film, propagate with an aspect ratio that increases linearly with applied strain (R2 ≥ 0.98). We define the rate of change of the aspect ratio of a microvoid with respect to applied strain as the "microvoid-propagation number." This dimensionless film parameter, previously unreported, is a useful measure of ductility in thin films supported by an elastomer. To explore the significance of this parameter, we correlate the microvoid-propagation number with nominal ductility using several ductile polymer films of approximately equal thickness. Since the fracture of a film supported by a substrate depends on the elastic mismatch, we study the effect of this mismatch on the propagation of microvoids and observe that the microvoid-propagation number increases with increasing elastic mismatch. Moreover, we find that thicker films exhibit greater resistance to the propagation of fracture. We hypothesize that this behavior may be attributed to a larger volume of the plastic zone and a higher density of entanglements. To understand how the intrinsic mechanical properties of a film influence the fracture behavior on a substrate, we perform tensile tests of notched and unnotched films floated on the surface of water. We find a linear correlation (R2 = 0.99) between the logarithm of the microvoid-propagation number and the fracture stress obtained from tensile tests of unnotched films.},
