### Course Description

The Advanced Instrumentation and Measurement course at MIT is a graduate level course that seeks to provide an in-depth dive into techniques for performing instrumentation and measurement of electrical, mechanical, biological, chemical, thermal, and optical systems. Lectures cover a range of theoretical and practical topics. Theoretical topics include linear and nonlinear system identification, while practical topics include an overview and usage of simulation softwares (ANSYS, Comsol, SolidWorks, Mathematica, EAGLE), electrical tools and skills (dynamic signal/system analyzer, impedance analyzer, soldering), machining tools (CNC mill, CNC lathe, 5-axis machining, laser machining, stereolithography, fused deposition modeling), optical techniques (microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy), and biological/chemical methods (rheology, gel electrophoresis). 

In addition to the course material, there is also a course project where students work in groups to develop an instrument that can perform system identification to measure some property of a system. 

### Personal Contributions
