### Course Motivation

In my experience, one of the most undersold skills of an engineer is the ability to communicate. From conveying complex ideas to a wide range of audiences, to effectively managing and dealing with conflict on a team, without effective communication skills, even the most talented engineers can struggle to make an impact. My aim with this course is to inform about the power communication has to make a personal and technical difference in the world. It is about building bridges, forging connections, and making an impact. 

### Proposed Content

The proposed course, "Communication for Technical Leaders", aims to empower the next generation of leaders to communicate with clarity, confidence, and impact. To do so, the following topics are proposed:
1. Understanding the role of communication in leadership
2. Methods for effectively communicating and listening
3. Delivering engaging presentations
4. Delivering and receiving feedback
5. Writing for different audiences
6. Difficult conversations
7. Communication with virtual teams
8. How to influence

Throughout the course, participants would engage with case studies, group discussions, role-playing exercises, and reflective writing assignments to gain more insight into past, present, and future communication situations. 

### Proposed Reading Material

The following readings are propose for augmenting class discussions and learning: 
1. "Difficult Conversations: How to Discuss What Matters Most" by Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, and Sheila Heen
2. "Crucial Conversations: Tools for Talking When Stakes Are High" by Kerry Patterson, Joseph Grenny, Ron McMillan, and Al Switzler
