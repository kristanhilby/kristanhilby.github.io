### Course Motivation
Depending on the system, closed form nonlinear dynamics are very difficult to derive. Often, the work around is to linearize the system around some operation point and derive the dynamics from there. While this is sufficient for certain systems, cases which include time varying dynamics cannot be modeled this way. Furthermore, as the system complexity grows, the dimension of the state grows drastically. This effect makes real time evaluation of system dynamics computationally expensive. Machine learning methods can be used to fit a nonlinear model to capture the entire state space with less parameters. Learning how to do this, and what scenarios we want to do this, is the heart of this course!

### Proposed Content
The proposed course, "Machine Learning System Dynamics", aims to provide students with the fundamental understanding of how machine learning can be used to model the dynamics of physical systems, as well as the tools to do so. The following topics are proposed:
1. A brief introduction to machine learning
2. A brief introduction to system dynamics
3. Reduced order modeling of systems
4. Traditional system modeling methods
5. Using machine learning
6. Error quantification and model validation 

Throughout the course, participants will learn the theory of system modeling and various methods for deriving a system model. Students will also work on a course project in which they need to utilize machine learning reduced order methods for modeling a system. 

### Relevant Experience
As part of my PhD, I extended a reduced order machine learning method based on the optimization of an augmented lagrangian with dissipation terms. This project is covered in more depth on the project page HERE.
