The Academic Job Search class seeks to provide final year graduate students and post doctoral staff guidance through the academic job search and application process through lectures and peer review. Topics include CV, cover letter, research statement, teaching statement, diversity statement, interview and job talk, and post-offer negotiations. In addition to the course content, faculty panels on each of the topics were held, and an academic career fair is provided.
