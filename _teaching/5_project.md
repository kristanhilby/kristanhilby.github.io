### Course Motivation
Diversity in teams is an essential ingredient to success and innovation. Research has shown that diverse teams are able to provide a wider range of ideas and more creative and innovative solutions. However, research has also shown that diverse teams may experience more conflict and disagreement, which can leave minority groups feeling unwelcomed and disrespected. The motivation for this course is to train future leaders not only the importance and power of diverse teams, but also how to foster respect, empathy, and inclusion in their team.   

### Proposed Content 
The proposed course on leading diverse teams aims to equip future engineers with the necessary skills and knowledge to effectively manage and lead diverse teams through creative projects. The course will cover essential topics, such as understanding the significance of diversity and inclusion in creative endeavors, identifying personal and team biases, and providing strategies for creating an inclusive work environment that values and leverages team diversity to improve innovation and productivity. The course aims to prepare students to create a positive impact by fostering diversity and inclusion in their work environments.

Throughout the course, participants will engage in interactive learning experiences where they will be expected to work in diverse teams on specific tasks. After the tasks are completed, students will evaluate the effectiveness of their team, as well as any observations of themselves and others in the team. In addition to interactive, experiential learning, students will engage in case studies and group discussion on class content.

By the end of the course, participants will have gained knowledge and skills about the importance and value of diverse teams and methods for fostering inclusion in a newly forming and already formed diverse team. 

## Potential Reading Materials
The following is a list of readings that changed the way I think about Leading Diverse Teams, and that I think would be useful to a course on the topic:
1. "Why Diversity Matters" by Katherine W. Phillips, Scientific American (2014)
2. "Think Again" by Adam Grant
3. "Unconscious Bias" by Mahzarin R Banaji and Anthony G. Greenwald, Harvard Business Review (2013)
4. "Creativity, Inc." by Ed Catmull and Amy Wallace, Random House (2014)
5. "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team" by Patrick Lencioni, Jossey-Bass (2012)

## Relevant Experience
During my time at MIT, I took two relevant courses that helped me forge this idea for a course. The first, 6.928 Leading Creative Teams, taught me how to build positive relationships, enhance interpersonal skills, develop creative solutions in a team environment, gain self awareness about leadership style, managing change and ambiguity in a project, and stress management. Through this course, I gained valuable insights from self-assessments and case studies on my leadership signature and how to effectively operate in a real-world scenario. 

The second course, 15.337 Teams Lab, helped me develop the skills and framework to analyze the key barriers and strengths that dictate team performance, while also providing methods for intervening. Through this course, I learned how to objectively analyze and understand the importance of a subjective experience, and use that knowledge to build, develop, and maintain effective team dynamics.
