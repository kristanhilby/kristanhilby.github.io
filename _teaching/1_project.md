> "One of the most exciting aspects of the workshop was the hands-on experience with the robot arms. We had the opportunity to program them to perform a variety of tasks, from simple movements to more complex operations like object recognition and manipulation. This workshop has further fueled my passion for robotics and technology. I am grateful to MIT and the American University of Bahrain for this amazing opportunity" -[Ebrahim Almalki](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ebrahim-almalki-13900020b_technology-learning-experience-activity-7028240519751188480-MrvC?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)
