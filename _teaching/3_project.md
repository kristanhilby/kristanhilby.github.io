<h4 id="overview_ch" style="text-align: center;">Workshop Description</h4>

At the [Collective Hub](https://www.collectivehub.co), I taught a free two day workshop titled "Introduction to Prototyping" to 25 students ranging from high school students up to post graduate working professionals. Students of the workshop had the opportunity to ideate a novel mug, starting from sketches, and then integrating the mug into Fusion 360. The content of the workshop was broken down into the following:

##### **Day 1** {#lect1_ch}
###### **Introduction to Prototyping Techniques**

On the first day of the workshop, participants learned about what a prototype is, what counts as a prototype, when to prototype, and how to prototype even when they may not have the tools accessible to them. To practice prototyping, participants were given the following prompt:

    <div class="col-sm mt-7 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/YateemCenter/mugactivity.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

Participants were instructed to create pencil and paper sketches for a novel mug concept, with the only requirement being that it needed to still hold liquid. 

##### **Day 2** {#lect2_ch}
###### **Introduction to Computer Aided Design (CAD)**

On the second day, workshop participants learned how to tranlate the paper sketches they had made the previous day into Fusion 360 CAD software. Participants were given the following iterative workflow for how to model in Fusion 360, with a deep dive into how to perform each step.

        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/YateemCenter/cadworkflow.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>

To exhibit the following steps, an example of extruding the Bahrain flag was covered in real time with the class. Participants were then instructed to create a model for the mug they had sketched the previous day. Wrapping up, participants were shown how to export files for laser machining and 3D printing.
