<h4 id="cod_rvis" style="text-align: center;">Course Overview & Description</h4>

At the Riffa Views International School (RVIS), I taught a two week course titled "Introduction to Prototyping and Robotics" to 20 students, ranging from freshman to seniors in high school. During the course, students experienced a range of activities to give them hands on experience with prototyping and elctronics, culminating in the fabrication of a robotic arm. The course was broken down into the following lectures:

##### **Lecture 1** {#lect1_rvis} 
###### **Introduction to Computer Aided Design (CAD)**

In this lecture, students learned the CAD workflow for Fusion 360 starting from creating a sketch, generating bodies from those sketches using extrude commands, and finally modifying and examining the developed bodies. For the latter half of the day, students formed teams and began initial prototyping of a gear system for lifting a bottle of water from the floor to the table with cardboard, foam, and other craft supplies.

##### **Lecture 2** {#lect2_rvis} 
###### **Introduction to Prototyping**

In the second lecture, students finished the introduction to CAD section learning assemblies. Afterwards, students were introduced to a range of prototyping methods, as well as each of the steps in the following prototyping process:

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">

</div>

To apply the skills they learned, students were put into new groups and were tasked with ideating and creating a platform that rolls down a platform carrying a bottle of water and can withstand a drop test. They were given guidance on performing short bursts of prototyping sessions. 

##### **Lecture 3** {#lect3_rvis}
######  **Introduction to Laser Machining**

During this lectures, students learned the principle of laser machining, and were introduced to using the laser cutter safely in the lab space. To apply their knowledge students continued working on the rolling platform prototype from the last class, not including one laser cut parts.

##### **Lecture 4** {#lect4_rvis} 
###### **Introduction to 3D Printing**
During this lecture, students learned the principle of 3D printing, how to design for 3D printed parts, and how to the printers in lab to further refine their rolling platform prototypes. During this class, students needed to prepare their platforms for a competition by showing they could survive a drop test.

##### **Lecture 5** {#lect5_rvis} 
###### **Conclusion to Prototyping**

During the fifth lecture, the student's prototypes were put to the test through a race against other teams. The cars raced against one another to the finish line.

##### **Lecture 6** {#lect6_rvis} 
###### **Introduction to Electronics**

During the sixth lecture, students learned a brief introduction to electronics and Arduino. From there, they were assigned to teams based on prior experience and learned how to use either a servo, potentiometer, or color sensor. Once they are able to operate different electronics, the students were assigned to teams to code an automatic, color-based ball sorter.

##### **Lecture 7 - 9** {#lect79_rvis}
###### **Concept Integration** 

After learning about Arduino and electronics, students worked to integrate all their skills (prototyping with laser cutter and 3D printers, CAD, and electronics) to build and control the following robot manipulator:

##### **Lecture 10** {#lect10_rvis} 
###### **Showcase and Competition**

During the final lecture, the class was opened up to the greater community to observe the achievements of the students and watch as the different teams competed to use their fabricated arms to throw a ball.
