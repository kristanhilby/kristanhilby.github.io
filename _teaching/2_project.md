<h4 id="cod_rvis" style="text-align: center;">Course Overview & Description</h4>
At the Riffa Views International School (RVIS), I taught a two week course titled "Introduction to Prototyping and Robotics" to 20 students, ranging from freshman to seniors in high school. During the course, students experienced a range of activities to give them hands on experience with prototyping and elctronics, culminating in the fabrication of a robotic arm. The course was broken down into the following lectures:

##### **Lecture 1. Introduction to Computer Aided Design (CAD)** {#lect1_rvis} 

In this lecture, students learned the CAD workflow for Fusion 360 starting from creating a sketch, generating bodies from those sketches using extrude commands, and finally modifying and examining the developed bodies. For the latter half of the day, students formed teams and began initial prototyping of a gear system for lifting a bottle of water from the floor to the table with cardboard, foam, and other craft supplies.

##### **Lecture 2. Introduction to Prototyping** {#lect2_rvis} 
In the second lecture, students finished the introduction to CAD section learning assemblies. Afterwards, students were introduced to a range of prototyping methods, as well as each of the steps in the following prototyping process:

    </div>

To apply the skills they learned, students were put into new groups and were tasked with ideating and creating a platform that rolls down a platform carrying a bottle of water and can withstand a drop test. They were given guidance on performing short bursts of prototyping sessions. 

##### **Lecture 3. Introduction to Laser Machining** {#lect3_rvis} 
During this lectures, students learned the principle of laser machining, and were introduced to using the laser cutter safely in the lab space. To apply their knowledge students continued working on the rolling platform prototype from the last class, not including one laser cut parts. 

##### **Lecture 4. Introduction to 3D Printing** {#lect4_rvis} 
During this lecture, students learned the principle of 3D printing, how to design for 3D printed parts, and how to the printers in lab to further refine their rolling platform prototypes.

##### **Lecture 5. Conclusion to Prototyping** {#lect5_rvis}
