I am currently a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the Mechanical Engineering Department where my research sits at the intersection of soft robotics and machine design. More specifically, it aims to look at ways of systematically integrating and utilizing compliance to enhance the performance envelope of traditionally rigid systems. In my time at MIT, I have been fortunate to work in the BioInstrumentation lab under Ian Hunter. 

Ever since obtaining my Bachelors of Science in NanoEngineering with a minor in Electrical Engineering from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), I have been interested in the ways soft robotics could augment and enhance the performance of traditionally rigid machines. In pursuit of this dream, my PhD has looked at augmeting the design of a novel type of vertical take off and landing (VTOL) aircraft known as a stop-rotor aircraft. A stop-rotor aircraft, which utilizes a single lifting surface in both VTOL and forward flight, is not a novel concept. In the early 2000s, Boeing showcased the design of the Dragonfly. However, the conflicting airfoil profiles and inherently unstable transition between VTOL and forward flight has posed an insurmountable challenge thus far to the adoption of stop-rotor aircraft. My research proposes utilizing a soft, morphing airfoil to enable to transition of the aircraft from VTOL to forward flight and resolve the conflicting airfoil needs. 

Though this is a specific application of soft robotics to enhance the performance of traditionally rigid machines, I am more broadly inspired by all machines relevant to space. I am passionate that the integration of soft robotics has the potential to enhance the safety and performance of systems we traditionally think of as rigid, such as cars, aircraft, and boats. opening up frontiers and capabilities that we may not even know exist.

In addition to my research interests, I have a deep passion for teaching, mentorship, and engineering leadership. Teaching and mentorship provide not only the opportunity to open up a new world to the next generation of students, but it also provides me with the opportunity to constantly learn. Engineering leadership, in my own education, has taught me how to share and disseminate information, understand how to navigate and promote diverse teams, and manage conflict in a team. I am of the belief that engineering leadership is one of the most necessary, and currently underutilized, tool in the engineer's toolbox.
