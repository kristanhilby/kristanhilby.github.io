For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like!

Need to figure out how to collect this page: have a combination between courses that I have taught (e.g., experience at RVIS, AUBH, two day workshop, TA for 2.131) and the courses that I want to teach (engineering leadership). Could also be an interesting intro section on my teaching philosophy: learning by failing.
