- Want to split similar to the projects page -
For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like!

Need to figure out how to collect this page: have a combination between courses that I have taught (e.g., experience at RVIS, AUBH, two day workshop, TA for 2.131) and the courses that I want to teach (engineering leadership). Could also be an interesting intro section on my teaching philosophy: learning by failing. 

In January of 2023, I traveling to Bahrain to teach three separate workshops, all centered around computer aided design and various prototyping techniques. 

Riffa Views International School (RVIS)
The first was a two-week workshop for high school students on computer aided design (CAD), various prototyping techniques (e.g., laser machining and 3D printing), and an introduction to electronics and arduino. Throughout the duration of the two week workshop, students created several smaller projects to help them build the skills towards the final project: Designing a pulley system for lifting a water bottle from the ground to a 1.5 m table, designing a mobile platform for transporting both a full and empty bottle of water off a steep drop, and programming a ball sorter that would classify and sort balls based on their color. Check out some photos below working with the students. 

Key takeaways: One of the biggest challenges working with the high school students was ensuring that they were all engaged and excited about the content. The students that took part in the workshop ranged from their first year to last year of high school, with some having experience in all areas of the workshop, while others had none. During the workshop, I began to adapt my teaching style to ask students more questions and make the experience more interactive. I found this kept students engaged at all levels. I also invited one of the more advanced students to give a guest lecture one day. Maintaining proper scaffolding was something I strived to achieve, because I found that students experienced the most joy at the end.

American University of Bahrain (AUBH)
After the two week workshop at RVIS, I taught a two week workshop at the American University of Bahrain, which was primarily composed of college students. In addition to the topics taught to the high school students, the curriculum was extended to include topics stuch as a broad overview of artificial intelligence, different types of motors, and different types of sensors. Unlike the high school students, the college students were expected to build a manipulator from scratch, and were encouraged to think outside of the box. 

Key takeaways: One of the biggest things I found as an instructor in the period where students were ideating was trying to keep their minds open to being creative and generating ideas that were truly novel. Although I sensed some frustration from students about generating several ideas for manipulators, by the end I found it led to a greater sense of investment and passion in the students. I tried to encourage students to hang on to ideas that may seem infeasible on paper before performing tests because the best way to learn is by failing. By the end, I could tell that all the students were proud and invested in their projects.

Innovation Hub of Bahrain 
In order to promote accessibility and diversity to the groups that were being reached throughout the workshops, a two day workshop was also held for primarily public school students that covered CAD and prototyping techniques without the hands on components seen at RVIS and AUBH. [Add more here]

Key Contributions: During this program, I was in charge of leading a team including myself, one Masters student, and two undergraduate students. This involved ensuring the curriculum was fully developed, all the materials were available, and coordinating with my team and the staff at the host schools to ensure daily deliverables were met. Overall, it was an incredibly rewarding process that put my engineering leadership skills to the test.
