description: One of my greatest passions in life is teaching and working with people. I have had the opportunity to teach under various settings and platforms to people ranging in age from freshman in high school to seniors in college. The following page includes some of my prior experiences teaching, topics I am passionate about and courses I would like to launch,  as well as a few existing courses I would be able to teach.
